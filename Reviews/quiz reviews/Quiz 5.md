- Binary search tree
    - class definition
    - insertion and removal
    - inorder traversal
    - construct binary search tree of min height given tree
        - in order traversal to get sorted list
        - then re input to get min height
- C++ statements for Zig and Zag
    - Also be able to show pattern for zig and zag
- Given binary search tree be able to splay a node
    - Will specify bottom up or top down splay
- definition of an AVL tree
    - Given tree find balance factor
    - after an insertion describe what happens to tree
        - balance factor
        - what rotations to fix
- Why is red black better than avl
    - 1 bit vs 2 bit
        - 0 for black 1 for red, 01 10 00 11 for avl
- Definition for red black tree
- 2-3 trees
    - Class definition
- Proof of why height of red black tree is Log(n)
- Height of AVL tree Log(n)
- height of splay tree n
