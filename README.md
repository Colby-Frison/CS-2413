This is all of the stuff from my time in CS-2413 - Data Structures at OU

## Projects

All projects are in the Projects folder

## Notes

Some are pretty rough, but most are alright

I use obsidian so whenever you see ![[file name]] that means there was at one point a picture there
Unfortunately I cant get those pictures, but most of them are just from the internet so just find em

## Reviews

All reviews are in the Reviews folder

Most of them are actually pretty good, the one for the final review literally just has everything from the class
So if ur trying to study for the final, that might be the one to look at
