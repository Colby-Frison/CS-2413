# CS-2413 Course Materials

This repository contains all course materials from my time in CS-2413 (Data Structures) taught by Sridhar Radhakrishnan at the University of Oklahoma in Fall 2024, including projects, notes, reviews, and more.

## Directory Structure

### 1. `Projects/`
Contains all programming projects for the course.
- Each project has its own folder (e.g., Project 1, Project 2, ...).
- Input/output files and executables are included for reference.

### 2. `notes/`
Class notes and reference materials.
- Some notes are rough, but most are detailed.
- Notes were originally written on Obsidian, so there are some things that are broken. Like if you see `![[file name]]` that means there was once an image there - most of them are just pulled from websites, but some are pictures from class, so apologies

### 3. `Reviews/`
Materials for exam and quiz review.
- All review sheets are in this folder.
- The final review is especially comprehensive, covering everything from the class and is highly recommended for final exam prep, or prepping for any given quiz or exam, as it has almost everything

## How to Use This Repository

- Use the notes and reviews as a study reference, not as a replacement for doing your own work.
- Projects can help you understand how to implement data structures and algorithms in C++, my code is kinda scuffed at times, but it works so its all good

## Additional Notes

- Most of the content here is tailored for my own understanding, but I like to try to explain things in simple terms so I can understand later, so hopefully everything works out.
- If youâ€™re studying for the final, or any other exam, start with the final review in the Reviews folder.
- The textbook unfortunately isn't the best, Sridhar is one of the authors of the book, so some of it is done HIS way instead of the industry standard, so if you get the textbook be warned.
    - DSA is a very important and common class, so there are A LOT of outside resources to help

- This class is not easy, make sure to stay on top of project and study throughout the semester instead of just cramming last second

**Good luck**
